# Datadog Integration Module
#
# This is a placeholder module for Datadog observability integration.
# Datadog provides both logging AND monitoring capabilities.
#
# NOTE: If you select Datadog, you typically don't need:
# - cloudwatchlogs (Datadog handles logs)
# - cloudwatchmonitoring (Datadog handles metrics)
# - splunk (redundant logging)
# - grafana (redundant dashboards)
#
# Actual implementation would typically involve:
# - Datadog Forwarder Lambda for CloudWatch logs
# - Datadog Agent on EC2/ECS/EKS
# - IAM roles for Datadog AWS integration

# Placeholder - no resources created
# Implementation requires Datadog API key and site configuration
