# AWS CodePipeline CI/CD Module
#
# This is a placeholder module for AWS CodePipeline CI/CD.
# CodePipeline is AWS's native continuous delivery service.
#
# NOTE: Choose ONE CI/CD solution:
# - githubactions (GitHub-native, works with any cloud)
# - codepipeline (AWS-native, deeper AWS integration)
#
# Actual implementation would typically involve:
# - CodePipeline pipeline resource
# - CodeBuild project for build/test stages
# - S3 bucket for pipeline artifacts
# - IAM roles for CodePipeline and CodeBuild
# - Source integration (CodeCommit, GitHub, S3)

# Placeholder - no resources created
# Implementation uses aws_codepipeline and aws_codebuild_project
