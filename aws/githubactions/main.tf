# GitHub Actions CI/CD Integration Module
#
# This is a placeholder module for GitHub Actions CI/CD integration.
# GitHub Actions is a CI/CD platform built into GitHub repositories.
#
# NOTE: Choose ONE CI/CD solution:
# - githubactions (GitHub-native, works with any cloud)
# - codepipeline (AWS-native, deeper AWS integration)
#
# Actual implementation would typically involve:
# - OIDC provider for GitHub Actions to assume IAM roles
# - IAM roles with least-privilege policies for deployments
# - GitHub repository secrets/variables configuration

# Placeholder - no resources created
# Implementation typically uses aws_iam_openid_connect_provider
