# Splunk Integration Module
#
# This is a placeholder module for Splunk log forwarding integration.
# Splunk is a third-party logging and observability platform.
#
# NOTE: You should only select ONE logging provider:
# - cloudwatchlogs (AWS-native)
# - splunk (third-party)
# - datadog (third-party, also does monitoring)
#
# Actual implementation would typically involve:
# - Kinesis Firehose to Splunk HEC endpoint
# - Lambda function for log transformation
# - IAM roles and policies

# Placeholder - no resources created
# Implementation depends on your Splunk deployment (Cloud vs Enterprise)
