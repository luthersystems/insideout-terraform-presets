# Grafana Integration Module
#
# This is a placeholder module for Amazon Managed Grafana (AMG).
# Grafana provides dashboards and visualization for metrics.
#
# NOTE: Grafana is typically used WITH a metrics source:
# - Use with cloudwatchmonitoring for CloudWatch metrics visualization
# - Or with Prometheus/AMP for custom metrics
#
# If you select Datadog, you typically don't need Grafana
# (Datadog has its own dashboards).
#
# Actual implementation would typically involve:
# - Amazon Managed Grafana workspace
# - IAM roles for Grafana to access CloudWatch/AMP
# - SSO/SAML configuration for user access

# Placeholder - no resources created
# Implementation requires workspace configuration and auth setup
